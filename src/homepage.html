            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>Our online galleries have its own distinct personalities, but are 
                united in their purpose to share exceptional art. Queensland Art 
                Gallery was established in 1895 and moved to its current residence 
                at South Bank in 1982. It was joined by the Gallery of Modern Art
                in 2006 and the galleries now house a globally significant collection
                of contemporary art from Australia, Asia and the Pacific.
